# Show/Hide Effect Walkthrough

## Scenario 1: Initial Render (Condition is `true`)

1.  **Effect Execution:** The `Show` effect runs because the condition is initially `true`.
    *   Console Log: `Show Effect RUNNING. Condition is: true`
2.  **Content Rendering:** The `renderContentPart` function processes the main content (`div`).
    *   Console Log: `renderContentPart: Received part: [div] object -> Processes the children array`
3.  **DOM Append:** The main `div` element is appended to the document fragment.
    *   Console Log: `renderContentPart: Part is Node. Appending: <div ...> -> Appends the main div to the fragment`
    *   Fragment child count becomes 1.
4.  **DOM Insertion:** The nodes from the fragment (the `div`) are inserted into the actual DOM after the designated marker.
    *   Console Log: `Nodes to insert: [div]`
    *   Console Log: `Nodes inserted after marker.`
5.  **Tracking Update:** The inserted `div` is now tracked.
    *   Console Log: `Updated tracked content: [div] -> Correctly inserts and tracks the children`

## Scenario 2: Click to Hide (Condition becomes `false`)

1.  **Effect Re-execution:** The `Show` effect runs again because the condition changed to `false`.
    *   Console Log: `Show Effect RUNNING. Condition is: false`
2.  **Identify Nodes for Cleanup:** The effect identifies the currently tracked nodes (the `div`) that need to be removed.
    *   Console Log: `Current tracked nodes (before cleanup): [div] -> Knows what to remove`
3.  **DOM Cleanup:** The previously rendered `div` is removed from the DOM.
    *   Console Log: `Attempting cleanup of old nodes...`
    *   Console Log: `Removed node: <div ...> -> Successfully removes the old children!`
4.  **Fallback Rendering:** The `renderContentPart` function processes the fallback content (`p`).
    *   Console Log: `renderContentPart: Received part: <p style="color: gray;">...</p> object -> Processes the fallback`
5.  **Fallback DOM Append:** The fallback `p` element is appended to the document fragment.
    *   Console Log: `renderContentPart: Part is Node. Appending: <p ...> -> Appends fallback to fragment`
    *   Console Log: `Node appended successfully to fragment. -> Success!`
    *   Fragment child count becomes 1.
6.  **Fallback DOM Insertion:** The nodes from the fragment (the `p`) are inserted into the actual DOM after the marker.
    *   Console Log: `Nodes to insert: [p]`
    *   Console Log: `Nodes inserted after marker. -> Successfully inserts the fallback!`
7.  **Tracking Update:** The inserted fallback `p` is now tracked.
    *   Console Log: `Updated tracked content: [p] -> Correctly tracks the fallback`
